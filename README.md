I Led the development of a prototype application called PICM. We used IBM Watson along with several other sources to create an android application that uses Image Recognition and Machine learning to identify objects in pictures and moreover classify them into appropriate disposal bins. This was initially intended to help with spreading awareness in regards to recycling and its relative importance when associated to the environment. After collecting more than 3200 pictures the results seemed fairly accurate. Some errors occurred when certain objects were scanned but given the time constraints, the results were great! I decided to create 5 separate classes that suited the recycling regulations of the city of Hamilton.
